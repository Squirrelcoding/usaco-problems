- If two cows interact and neither gets infected, then either:
  - At least one is infected and K hoove-shakes have already passed. I think taht in this case, we can update the bounds for K.
  - None are infected.

THE META: The main stratgey that we'll be using linked lists to form a timeline of interactions of each cow.

We already do have a timeline, but we want to be able to track the actions of each individual cow separately.

===== Finding patient 0 =====

- We keep track of each cow's interactions. How do we know if a cow is certainly not patient 0?
- Well, we would know if their first interaction does not cause the other cow to be infected. In this case, we can either see that either K=0 or... the cow just isn't infected.


===== Finding K ===== 

- How do we update the lower and upper bounds of K?
- We should
