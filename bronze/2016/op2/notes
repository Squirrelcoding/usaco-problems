== Step 1 ==

Create some sort of struct or data structure that can hold all of the pound symbols and has an easy
way to manipulate them so that they can be moved easily and checked if there are overlaps or anything like that

For each of these data structures we also want ALL of the possible ways that they can be shifted so that makes stuff
so much easier to check. 

Also implement a method that checks if two are equal for the final result.

We want to easily combine stuff...

== Step 2 ==

Loop through each of the input and put them into these data structures.

== Step 3 ==

Make a double loop that checks every possible combination of shapes

== Step 4 ==

Find the ones that match.
