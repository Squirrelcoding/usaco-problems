- One way to do this is to consider all possible combination of cows, count the number of
liars in each scenario, and return that. But this has O(2^n) time complexity...

- We should consider all "greater than" statements and "less than" statements.
- If two of these are incompatible, then we know that at least one cow is lying.
- Actually, we should count the number of unique rows for which there is an X and do the same 
for columns, and take the minimum of the two.

- Notice that all less/greater than statements are compatible.Type

- Find the minimum number of cows needed to be removed to make everything true


- For every pair of potentially lying cows, we know that one of them is lying duhhhh

- But how do we choose which one is actually lying? The task is to find the minimum amount, so
it makes perfect sense that we should choose the one that caused the MOST number of contradictions!
