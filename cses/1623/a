- probably better ways to do it then to brute force every single possible combination

- Clearly, some combinations are simply not good, such as all of the integers with an empty list

- Split a set of integers S into two subsets such that their difference is a minimum


- Clearly, the maximum has to be in one of the two sets.

- Start by putting the maximum in one of the two sets and start by adding the next few ones in the next set
until we exceed the other one.

- Step 1: sort it
- Step 2: Z

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
